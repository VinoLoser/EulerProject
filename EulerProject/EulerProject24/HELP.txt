keep doing this until it reaches the 1 millionth number
    first swap the last 2 numbers
    then check if said number is in decending order and if it is then:
        first check if number is already your largest number
            if it is, then move to the next number
        if it is in decending order, then put in accending order and swap
        finally set the maxnumber back to the 3rd to last number
